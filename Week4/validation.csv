__label__1 "these are my new favorite jeans . the gray wash is nice and the distressing is subtle enough that i can wear these to work . the rise is high enough that i do n't need to worry about bending over but not so high that they get near my belly button . and the description is true : they do n't stretch ! i 'm a loyal ag stevie shopper and the fit on these is similar ... just a little skinnier in the ankles maybe . true to size . a little long so i 'll probably hem them a couple of inches ."
__label__-1 "ordered this vest on line and returned it due too poor quality ."
__label__-1 "i loved the look of this top online - it had great lines . i was so disappointed when i received it . it has zero support/lining and i 'm not large chested to need a lot . it 's also incredibly awkward to get on and the tie in the back is only long enough to knot it making it even harder to get off . it was returned ."
__label__-1 "i hate to be so negative but i ca n't believe this shirt has so many positive reviews . it is stiff silver lace and hangs funny if you have a chest . adding a cami undnerneath makes it worse . looks cheap ."
__label__1 "love the pockets ! fits loose but lies nicely . comfy but able to be dressed up or down . great versatile dress ."
__label__0 "it 's a t-shirt . a very cute print nice cut very soft -- but a t-shirt . therefore why is it almost $ 50 ? ? ? ? tried it on in the store and loved it but i just ca n't justify $ 50 for a t-shirt . for those who will not be deterred by the price : i normally wear about an 8-10 dress size at retailer and the medium fit well ."
__label__-1 "i 'm upset . i ordered the grey sweatshirt and while the description says the sweatshirt has a zipper the picture of the grey does not have a zipper . i prefer no zipper so when it arrived in the mail with a zipper i was disappointed . it 's going back . why have a model where an item that you 're not offering ? ? ?"
__label__1 "the sweater is as cute in person as it is online ."
__label__1 "i got this for my daughter ( teen ) who had been wanting this plaid look but did n't want to look like a lumberjack ! this is feminine and can be dressed up or down . it has the high low look that she loves and it is comfortable and machine washable ! she will get a lot of use out of this purchase ! new item but black friday discount ! yay ! purchased in red color ."
__label__1 "these did n't work for me because i am too straight shaped for these jeans . try them if you have a smaller waist and curvy hips and bottom ! i did n't have anything to fill out the hips and seat . for reference i ordered size 25 and they were loose in hip and seat but fit my waist . my hips are 34.5 and waist is 28. they are a thinner stretch denim than they appear but not jeggings thin ."
__label__-1 "i ordered not one but two sizes of this dress to try on and was hoping to ultimately wear to an event - one 00 petite one 00. the style color and cut are all perfect . one not so minor downfall however . the zippers on both dresses were faulty - they both broke in the same spot both during the first time just trying them on . i ca n't get either of them to even budge now - will either need to take back or get fixed . very sad about this ."
__label__0 "i have been lusting after this dress and though tit would be great for thanksgiving . the fit for me however is totally wrong . for reference i 'm 32dd 5 ' 8 140 lbs and am a s or 4. the small fit well in the body area but felt a little small in my upper arms . the arm length was more of a 3/4 sleeve on me which looked terrible because the sleeves are baggy . the quality felt like it was lacking too . the material felt like it would pill easily . order with caution ."
__label__-1 "hi i would have to agree with all of the reviewers.i unfortunately had to find out for myself . mistake . it 's huge . i love the quality and design but even if you sized down two sizes it would n't help ."
__label__1 "great soft basic . low scoop neck makes this tank flirty while the thicker strap keeps it modest . i absolutely love this top easily dress up and down !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store . but i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash ( even when following washing instructions ) . i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially ! i 'm so disappointed . how can you make a shirt that ca n't withstand washing ? !"
__label__0 "these are a wonderful trouser style pant . i love fitted than flared denim so this fit is n't my top pick but it 's a cute style ! thick quality denim fabric with a medium rise cut ."
__label__0 "this vest is very nice and fashionable very stylish . i like it a lot . however it is too itchy . the opening in the front did n't allow me to close as many buttons as i like but i would totally wear this stylish vest even though it is not as functional when it is cold . however the itchiness is too much . i do n't wear wool unless it is ultra soft or mixed with cashmere so i could not imaging wearing this vest it is too itchy . why ruin such a good thing ?"
__label__1 "love this blouse . per the previous review there was no problem with my tailoring . it is exactly as shown . i plan to handwash this and take super good care of it . you can tell from the picture it could be an excellent wardrobe staple and absolutely timeless as well as the kind of sexy and elegant you can get away with in the office . i do think it runs a tiny bit small . however it is not short . it 's just quite a fitted piece . i would consider sizing up . i love the look of the medium on me 5'10"
__label__1 "i am usually a 00 or 0 in dresses and i ended up with a 4 in this one . i could barley zip up the 0 and while i could have gotten away with the 2 there is no elasticity in the waistband . the 4 is very slightly roomy but more comfortable than the smaller sizes on me . for reference i 'm 109-111 lbs 5 ' 4 and a 30b . when i was finally able to wear the dress i got compliments galore . it really is a beautiful dress ! just be sure to size up !"
__label__1 "thanks to the vertical stripes the adjustable neckline the bow that cinches the waist and the free flowing skirt this dress is extremely flattering . the compliments i received when wearing this dress back that up ! i was unsure if i should order a medium or large because i typically wear either/or depending on the dress style due to my hips . i ordered a large which fit thanks to the adjustable neckline and adjustable waist but a medium definitely would have worked just as well for me ( i just"
__label__1 "i saw this dress online and b-lined it to the store to try on . it is a beautifully made dress . lots of great detail with stitching and beading on the front placket . feels very boho and chic . i have received lots of compliments while wearing this dress . i was almost turned off by the price but decided to see it in person . worth every penny . wear it with sandals or tall boots could have worn a medium but a little tight for 38c on top ."
__label__-1 "i look like i put a baggy bag over my head . also the material really seemed like fake velvet to me ."
__label__0 "i went on a wild goose chase for these jeans as they were sold out all around the country . i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest ! they are my favorite pair of jeans they fit very well . however for the price they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears . i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly . expensive jeans should not sag . i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose even after 20 wears"
__label__-1 "extremely disappointed with this top . it runs extremely large . i 'm 5 ' 2 130 lbs 34c and usually wear between a 0-2 & xs-s tops at retailer . i ordered a 0 and it looked like a maternity top on me . the bottom half of the top flared out and did not fit close to the body at all . fabric was also a gauze-like material that was not soft . unfortunately i will be returning ."
__label__0 "this is the perfect day dress -- loose fit comfortable fabric . i usually wear a m or l in most dresses of this type but the s actually was the best fit . i have worn it all summer and it 's perfect for hot weather . just order smaller ."
__label__0 "i love how this dress is photographed but when it arrived to my doorstep i was highly disappointed . there seems to be no shape to it whatsoever . the fabric is much stiffer than i was expected i thought it was going to be more like a sweater dress but it is not an overly comfortable fabric and it does not move like i thought it would when i put it on . this one is going back ."

__label__0 "very pretty top . however you absolutely need to try it on before ordering . fit well in the chest area but way too big in the sides - i looked pregnant . had to return ."
__label__1 "i wore this to an engagement party and got compliments all night . it is absolutely gorgeous and very slimming ! i got a petite 4 and it fit perfectly . for reference . i am 5 ' 2 and 125 lbs . you ill not regret buying this dress !"
__label__-1 "i sized way down and this top was still shapeless and tent-like . the sweatshirt fabric overpowered the cute feminine details ."
__label__1 "these pants are adorable . i am a petite lady with a small waist and have a hard time finding pants that fit and look good but these do . they are both cute and elegant . and they have pockets . i have had many compliments . the one drawback is they need dry cleaning ."

__label__0 "i think this top would have been amazing if it was in a jersey or cotton club but the gauzey fabric is so wrinkly and so sheer i do n't know how i would use this top . i do n't mind most of the slightly sheer retailer tops ( if people see my bra slightly so be it ) but this is really sheer unless you are madonna you are going to want to wear something under this and in my mind that defeats the purpose of a lightweight sleeveless top . i returned it and was sorry to have to do that ."
__label__-1 "i feel that for this price i should love this top ( and i wanted to ) . however the price is on the high side for a relatively basic top and there were a few things about it that could be improved . pros : i ordered a medium and feel that it 's pretty true to size . additionally the fabric is nice and light ( but also * sheer * ) and generally speaking has a nice pattern . overall it 's a very pretty top . cons : there 's a cute criss-cross ruffle thing happening in the back but the model has cleverly"

__label__-1 "retailer consistently provides unique sophisticated and quality made clothing . with the exception of an occasional purchase at their sister companies i shop with them exclusively . i suppose that i ca n't expect 100 % perfection from retailer-but 99 % of the time-that 's what i get . this is that 1 % ... this sweater is truly awful ! i can not ( or find it very difficult at least ) begin to describe what this sweater is like but it is so unlike retailer that had it not been for the distinct pattern on the front"
__label__1 "fits true to size and rides the line between contemporary and retro exceptionally well ."
__label__0 "i like the look of this sweater and i am keeping it . however i found the fit under the arms a little uncomfortable . there is a large seem that goes under the armpit and is a little bulky and irritating . also would not recommend if you are busty . because of how the stripes run it looks stretched out over my chest ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes for this dress but unfortunately it misses the mark completely . the design is flawed in that you can not raise your arms to shoulder length . for someone who is 5 ' 3 105lbs the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander 's derelict campaign . i think one must have a specific body type for this dress but regardless they 'll have to keep their arms at their sides ."
__label__-1 "i was really wanting a nice white summer blouse to pair with patterned skirts . unfortunately this fell short as it was huge . not only was it big it flared at the bottom . it would be perfect if i was sporting a baby bump but not what i am going for right now . if the tank was a bit slimmer i would have kept it as a tunic.i 'm sad that i 'll have to return it ."
__label__1 "ok so this is adorable . i am 5 ' 3 and medium size and had to take this to my alterations people because i loved it so much but it fit awkwardly . the back was too long and hung funny on my short body . after it was reworked it is the cutest thing i own . they also made the little belt tighter across my waist . it is super versatile . my alterations people ran out and bought themselves one after they saw mine . so -- -- if you are not a toothpick or tall know it can be amazing with a little attention ."
__label__1 "very cute on fits well . versatile top i think it will work well with a sweater or blazer for fall ."
__label__0 "this immediately caught my eye in the neutral pattern and the fabric is actually quite nice . the fit is at least a size or two too large though with the bust being way too large for me even sizing down . my normal 4 was big everywhere and the 2 was still big in the chest but fit everywhere else . the belt is handy for cinching in some of the loose areas but the top section just did n't work for me . maybe better for someone better endowed ?"
__label__-1 "i was really excited to get this dress i initially ordered a small ( i am a size 4 ) but when i tried it on it was really tight . the bodice at the top fit strangely-i had to shorten the straps quite a bit and the dress just looked off . i love retailer and get all of my dresses from there and the look of the dress on line was beautiful but just did n't fit right . i did love the lace look and would love seeing more dresses with this design ."
__label__1 "i just bought this and really think it is a great dress ! it is conservative and i will be able to wear it to teach or play the organ at my church . i am a church organist and college professor and need conservative clothes yet i do not like to look frumpy . this is cute and chic yet conservative . also j got 25 % because it is black friday . thank you retailer ! ! !"
__label__0 "i love tunics and really wanted this to work . i got this in a size s and it is absolutely gigantic . everything else about it is great and i still have n't decided if i will try to swap it for an xs which is definitely not my usual size ( which is usually m but often s at retailer ) . the pink/red color was quite pretty . if you have broad hips fear not - you can size down and this top will still be generous around your hips . basically if you 're deliberating between s and m for this top get"

__label__0 "i love the idea of ruffles but this shirt was huge ! i normally wear a small or medium and i got the small . it felt more like a large to me . maybe if you size down 1-2 sizes it will work out for you . i 'm going to take it back rather than exchange . i also wish it was a more lightweight material for summer but it 's pretty thick ."
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this ! the fabric is beautiful - comfy soft and a great wash/print of blue . it reminded me of the ocean . however the fit was off . the waist was too high the length too short and the straps to long . i was very disappointed . i considered taking it to the tailor before returning . ultimately i decided to return ."

__label__-1 "first the fabric is beautiful and lovely for spring and summer . i really wanted to like this top but the fitting is so awkward for me . i typically where a 0/xs and sized up in the shirt to a size 2. it was very tight and pulled funny across the chest ( size 32/a ) . i also found the cut at the shoulders very narrow ( need a strapless bra ) and made it look unflattering overall . had to return this one back to the store ."
__label__1 "i have so many compliments on this blouse . i love the style and design . i wear it with my long cotton skirt because it runs a little short since i have a long torso and i am 58 tall . i would love to wear it with my skinny pants but then it wo n't look right in the back kinda hang out . otherwise really nice quality blouse . i would definitely buy another just to have a back up ."
__label__-1 "this tank ( in black ) is nice quality most of the fringe hangs straight and seems to be attached well . it 's just too short and too boxy for my figure ( curvy/hips ) . would look good on someone who has straight hips and is not long waisted . since that does n't describe me it has to go back ."
__label__0 "at first i was interested . i liked the color the soft tencel fabric the cut in the back . it was all good . they did n't have my size in the store so i had to order it . when it arrived in the mail it was folded up and wrinkled . i tried it on and it looked like a lifeless unstructured blazer . i sent it back . all in all it is cute and fun for warm weather . it is definitely a casual blazer . i 'd probably wait for a sale on this one . it does run tts ."

__label__0 "so i was super excited to get this skirt unfortunately it 's not what i thought it would be . the color is much different then what pictured it has bronze threading and the black on the picture is more gray in real life . the material is n't so great easier i thought it would be thicker but instead it 's pretty thin and wrinkles easy . the design is very cute and it is a flattering shape but the material is just too poor for me to give this a good rating . i would n't say it 's itchy like the other re"

__label__0 "this dress was so lovely in person but when i put it on ... ooh la la ! it is short ! i am 5 ' 3 and i would not walk outside in this dress without something underneath . it just needed one more tier and i would have kept it for sure . too bad !"
__label__-1 "i was very excited about this product . when i saw it the pattern was beautiful in the romantic floral and the bottom band looked like the bathing suit was a little longer so i felt it would be good for a large chest . when i received the package i knew instantly it ran small . i tried it on and it barely covered half of my chest . also the band at the bottom is actually very small and not what i expected . the print is just as lovely in person as it is online . i do n't even know if sizing up will mak"

__label__0 "like the previous reviewer the biggest problem with this shirt is how short it is . i 'm 5 ' 4 and ordered a 12 which is usually what i wear at retailer . even only being 5 ' 4 this shirt is much shorter than i anticipated . it fits everywhere else though . i 'm obsessed with the back so i 'm going to keep it and wear it . i 'd say it 's worth it at the sale price ."
__label__0 "it was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom . the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt . i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it 's definitely not worth $ 60 ."

__label__0 "i really like the dress the material the print and the pleated skirt are totally fun . however the neckline is a bit to low and a cami is necessary at least for me . the material is very sheer which will be noted on the sleeves and the lower skirt where the liner falls short ( about 4 inches above the knee ) .the main draw back i personally have with this dress is taking it off . there are no zippers or buttons . getting it on is easy not so when taking it off !"

__label__1 "the colors are beautiful on this shirt and it is true to size . it is very comfortable but i wish the flowing part on top was pinned under arms or something . it is attached at the top of the tank top but nowhere else so it just kind of lays over the tank with a poncho look.i also think the top layer would look better if it was longer- it hits at my natural waist and i 'm petite . i still plan on keeping it and think it will be cute enough with jeans . just really wanted to love it !"
__label__-1 "i 'm normally a small in retailer tops . i ordered a small and the top fit well in the shoulders and in the upper ( more fitted ) part . it all went horribly wrong from there . the top billowed out at the bottom and fit like a circus tent instantly adding a good 50 pounds to my frame . this was such a disappointment as the pattern is beautiful and the fabric is high quality ."
__label__0 "as with many of retailer 's tops these days there is a lot of fabric on this tee . it hangs fairly well though . the white color is cream which did n't work for me but is n't bad . a little sheer but wearable with a nude bra . if you have a thinnish upper body order down a size !"
__label__-1 "i ordered the top from a store to have it shipped . it is very pretty but once on it fit the wrong way . i got a small because i know that this designer tends to run tight across the bust . the shoulder was too rounded for this neck line . sleeves should have been either longer or sleeveless . the empire waist even on a smaller busted woman like myself was cut too high ."
__label__0 "maybe if i sized down to a small i 'd like them better .. they look ok from the front . but it seems like the leg was cut way too wide . there is exceess material in the back and leg hole . they are not all flattering to my rear end . overall kind of shapeless and the fabric is prone too wrinkling . too expensive ( with the added shipping fee for an online exclusive ) for the lack of structure and simplicity ."
__label__-1 "this dress was very boxy and unflattering . i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back ."
__label__-1 "this item is pretty the print on the fabric is nice and reminiscent of embroidery but only the top portion has a few embroidered accents . my issue with it is it 's very impractical . the fabric is extremely thin and you would n't want to wear it in any weather below 75 degrees . it 's ridiculous to advertise this product for a fall/winter season . the tube top underneath does n't work very hard to stay up and is n't a very practical way to hold up the jumpsuit ( why wouldnt they just stitch a lining"
__label__1 "these pants are so soft and so comfortable ! i was absolutely in love at first sight . however i got the petite because i am 5 ' 3 and they were still a little longer than i like my pants to be . i wanted them to hit right above the ankle just like the photo however they are a tad longer . i still love them and they are still as comfy as ever so i am gon na deal with the length ! !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to order this sweater . i thought that the moss color would make it a great basic for work or casual days . ordering it on sale made it all the better . however when it came i was so sad to see how muted the colors were with little definition . the sweater itself lacks definition as well just shapeless and hangy . i also did not expect the angora like hair on the sweater which bothered by eyes as soon as i tried it on ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this jacket . so soft and great color . unfortunately it is just too light weight . it is almost like shirt fabric . nice heft to the fabric though . nice length - accept the sleeves were short on me . i am 5'10 and 135lbs . the small was the right size . i was looking for something slightly warmer to layer ."
__label__1 "these pants are a life saver . i love to travel with them and have washed them in a hotel sink rolled in a towel and hung dry with good results . picro does not usually fit me well these pants are the exception . i 'm 5 ' 6 and if i uncuff them they can be worn as regular length . great for a baseball game ! i will panic if retailer ever changes or discontinues them ! ! ! !"
__label__-1 "i had to return this blouse because it ended up been too small and super itchy . im kind of busty but medium usually works and this one was super tight across my chest . not comfortable at all and the fabric is kind of a sheer with the sparkly lines in silver . would n't recommend it ."
__label__-1 "looks like a pregnancy top . a lot gathers in front and back . added 10 pounds to me . not flattering on much longer than on the model . and the color is not white . it 's white with a weird tan/ taupe stripe . i returned it same day i received it which was disappointing ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this was so excited when i ordered it online . the fabric ( blue and white ) was beautiful but the cut was bad . it fit me like a maternity top and made me look like i was 6 months along . i have a feeling that the models had theirs pinned back in the back because it does not lay flat like that in front it has a lot of fabric with no place to go but up and out . returning ."
__label__1 "i bought this blouse in the purple motif and love it for work . great design and print . based on the existing reviews i sized down from my normal xs to an xxs and i actually wish that i would have stuck with the xs only because the blouse is tighter on my biceps than i would prefer but i am keeping the blouse . i always appreciate this in other reviews so hopefully it helps : i 'm 5 ' 2 117 lbs and a small 32b ."
__label__0 "this shirt is thin and probably not worth full price but it was flattering to my figure . covered my post baby tummy and complimented/minimized my g size chest but the cut was off . the seams for the arms were almost in the front at the chest so when i moved my arms i had limited movement forward and it pushed the embroidered panel out and was just irritating . an entire day of readjusting my shirt would drive me crazy . i tried the m and the l ."
__label__-1 "these pants are gorgeous when you first see them . they fit beautifully when you first put them on . and then you wear them for one day . and they snag . on everything . and little strings start to come out of the pants . and the hem begins to unravel . and the pants which were once beautiful light summer pants appropriate for work or brunch are now frumpy worn out pants with a million snags and strings hanging off of them .... after one day . i ca n't begin to tell you how annoyed i am that i spent"
__label__-1 "usually an retailer dress in a large fits me perfectly however not this one . i am larger busted and this dress was way too tight on top . possibly better on smaller chests . the dress is cute and the rest of the fit was good . not for me could barely pull it down over the boobs . going back : ("
__label__-1 "i knew that the cut of this shirt was boxy but this is huge . i wear a l or xl at retailer and i got the m/l and was swimming in this top . sadly this will be going back ."
__label__-1 "the sweater was nice but not as long as on the model . it was itchy also . this sweater was not what i had expected . their was nothing exceptional about it to spend that kind of hard earned cash sorry retailer . i sent it back ."
__label__-1 "i know this product description says oversized but that 's an understatement . i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father 's jacket . i do n't even think an xs would have worked . i 'm 5 ' 6 and about 135 pounds for reference . i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it 's just way too big ."
__label__-1 "i was looking for a casual dress for quick errands that was trendy but comfy . this dress had a lot of potential [ i was drawn to the print ] but the material is awful . so thin and scratchy ! immediately went back ."
__label__1 "the quality of this vest is outstanding and the warmth is exceptional . i have worn it as a jacket on milder days in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe . it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted . it runs large by style but i am 5 ' 1 100 lbs and i can carry it off ."
__label__-1 "this top has a nice design . i love the lace up back which makes it much more adjustable in shape . if you lace it lower it is more flattering to your waist . however the fabric quality is very poor on the white tank . it arrived with a small tear in the front hem area which i could have easily fixed . it is very sheer ; even with a nude bra my bra was too visible for my comfort . plan on wearing a full camisole underneath tank or bralette you are fine with being on display ."
__label__-1 "the fit of the top is true to size but i really do n't like the taupe terrycloth-like sweatshirt under the white lace . the white lace is bright white and seems very sturdy but it makes the sweatshirt underneath look very dirty and very noticeably taupe . it is terrible paired together . i also did n't like the feel of the terrycloth-like fabric against my skin . even though this is a good quality piece with a lot of interesting detail i 'm absolutely sending it back ."
__label__-1 "this did n't work for me . the piece looked cheap rode very high ... needed to be longer . the piece looks incomplete for some reason to my eyes . it also does not seem quality for an retailer piece . this went back ."
__label__1 "this hoodie is just what i had hoped it would be ... it is super soft comfortably loose but with the tie bottom hugging the hips and low v-neck - it 's just the right amount of sexy . it will be my go-to this fall and winter !"
__label__1 "this is the perfect sweater dress for any occasion . i dressed it up with a belt and necklace for a christmas party and wore it with boots to just kick around the house . it 's a really warm dress too so great for colder weather . probably would not want to wear this dress in warm temps . it 's so comfortable and it 's made with high quality material . i 'm curvy on the bottom and my only wish is that this dress had less material around my waist- it 's a pretty straight cut ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this tunic sweater . the material is so soft and a perfect weight . the color is pretty . bu the fit absolutely did not work for me . the tunic runs very small . a large usually fits me but i felt like i was wearing a small . the slits are quite high . i was sorry to do it but this one went straight back !"
__label__-1 "i had high hopes for this top based on the photos but when it arrived it is a very thin cheap feeling top . the color is a dusty rose color that has a yellowish mottle throughout it almost like a tie dye or slub effect . not pretty at all ."
__label__-1 "wanted to love this dress - pretty fabric and colors . i think it would be more flattering on a taller woman ( i 'm 5 ' 3 ordered a s ) this just looked like a nightgown on me . sorry to say it 's going back ."
__label__1 "i really like these but my usual size 29 did not fit . i always wear that size in pilcro but these were at least a size two small and i have to return them . regretfully they are out of size 30 so i lose out . wish there had been previous reviews to let me know so i 'm doing so now for anyone thinking of ordering ."
__label__0 "very cute and high-quality dress but it is very short . the length would n't be that much of an issue except for the fringe ( which is awesome and unique by the way ) hits right at the butt . wish this dress ( and subsequently the fringe ) was 3 inches longer ."
__label__1 "these leggings run true to size . the strappy detail at the ankle is a nice touch . i especially like the quality of the material used as they are not see-through like some leggings tend to be ."
__label__1 "so i love this top . i got it in black and red . both are amazing and go with about anything . they run a bit large . i sort of forgot to read the label and thought it was just a cotton turtleneck . i threw it in the washer on regular settings and cold water and hung it to dry . i would say it shrunk 10 % at most . beyond that no difference . in fact it fits better after it shrank since it was a bit big . obviously if you do not dry clean this you are going against manufacturer recommendations but i"
__label__0 "the shape was not as nice on model seemed like a lot of extra material ."
__label__-1 "this dress is not flattering . the slip is very small and short and the dress is big and billowy . like the other reviewer said its more like a tablecloth that you stick your head through . it was really hard to figure out how to cinch in the waist but it did n't help regardless . the length is not accurate either . i would say it 's a pretty short dress ( mid thigh ) but that probably depends on the person . it also makes you look very horizontal . i was really excited about this dress but it 's getting r"
__label__1 "i love this top soooooo much ! i love straps and i love tops that will show some of my sports bra in the back since i tend to buy some that have some strappiness . i love that this top has it all-it is lightweight and it has some character so it is more attractive than an everyday kind of workout top . it is comfortable even for classes like body pump where you are constantly moving your arms . i love that the colors are not bold i am sick of neon ! ! ! !"
__label__-1 "while i love the design and shape of this blouse the fabric was of very poor quality . i will return it ."
__label__-1 "the colors are so much brighter than pictured . although the sweater is very comfortable i did not like the color combination . i will be returning it ."
__label__0 "purchased because i wanted a deep red sweater and this one was the perfect color . unfortunately i am on the curvier side with 34g chest 155lbs 5 ' 5 and the med was too big ( i usually wear m or l at retailer . ) also the fit ended up being boxy on my body type ."
__label__0 "really wanted to love this top ... it is beautiful with very good quality but ... ran small and tight ... also the bottom sides flare out as if it was stitched with too much material looking awkward ..."
__label__-1 "i tried this shirt in the purple motif it fit true to size my normal small worked well . all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in . really ? on a white shirt ? it annoyed me so much i did n't buy the shirt ."
__label__-1 "this dress was really odd . i loved the quirky mixture of the blue stripe and the floral but that 's about it . the shape was unflattering but honestly that could be because this dress ran large . i was just very underwhelmed with this dress . also the hidden button zipper at the front was an amazing idea but not the best execution . overall its okay just hated it on me ."
__label__0 "i purchased this on sale xxs petite and i 'm glad i did . it 's an adorable sweater but i knew the moment i put it on - itch city ! bummer . i wore it with a tank underneath and that helped . it 's a very warm sweater and the style is really cute . looks really soft and cozy but i would say itchy and cozy !"
__label__-1 "this cardi is cuter in the stock photos . in person the colors are a bit more drab . stock photos also do n't show quite how much of a swing shape this has . it is very soft though . returned it !"
__label__0 "i purchased these on sale and am only keeping them because they were such a low price . i ordered the 2 petite but they do not actually seem to be made for a petite person . they are still very long ( to my ankles ) and the legs are very wide . the waist fits fine though ."
__label__1 "love this with leggings or jeans for a casual look . quality seems ok though i 'm hoping for no shrinkage after i wash since it 's the perfect length at the moment ( i 'm 5 ' 7 and it just covers my butt ) . good sale purchase !"
__label__-1 "there was nothing i liked about this coat . it was definitely not designed with a chest in mind . the pins on the straps were already coming off the first time i tried it on . i usually like oranges too but even this color turned me off ."
__label__-1 "beautiful color and the fabric is very substantial and soft . but they did n't finish the bottom hem ! the dress is lined and the bottom inside has a ribbon sewn in as a type of hem but the actual edge is just cut and not turned in on itself . because of this the whole bottom had a hundred little fabric frays . the rest of the dress is so polished it just does n't make sense . also while the fabric is beautiful my dress had a weird mark on the chest almost like a water mark . just overall bad attent"
__label__1 "this tank is really thin and airy without being too flowy . it was perfect for my soul cycle workout and i am thinking about getting it in different colors for working out . i do n't know that i 'd normally wear this top on its own because it 's very casual but it 's perfect as part of a workout or vacation outfit . i sized down one size to make sure that it was n't too flowy and it fit perfectly . i am 5 ' 2 and 130lbs . and a size xs fit perfectly ."
__label__0 "i was looking forward to trying this on after seeing it in the catalog . i wear an xs or small in retailer tops and tried this on in an xs . it was huge . reminded me of a maternity top . it was much more flowy on me than it looks on the model . the material was nice thin but not see through . the macrame detailing seemed well made . i 'd recommend this if you 're looking for a flowy top but definitely size down ."
__label__-1 "if you are thinking about purchasing this dress without trying on in person i bet you are n't going to be happy with it . for a phisique that is 5 ' 3 and 115lbs this dress is not too short . however the back key hole design is just not flattering . i felt like clothes in the back shoulder area is not fitted well and the zip up closure is not all the way zipped up even though it was so ."
__label__1 "beautiful colors . lightweight flannel so a great pair of sleep pants that can be worn year round . i ordered a s my typical size which turned out to be quite large on me . hopefully the xs will fit better ."
__label__1 "this is such an easy dress to wear and it looks very polished ! it is not a cheap polyester fabric as one reviewer wrote . it is a rayon and nylon blend . it does wrinkle easily . i love that the belt is actually sewn into the dress at the back . i do n't typically gravitate toward warm color palette but the burnt orange color is really lovely . it can be dressed up or down very easily . and it has pockets ! i typically wear xs in retailer brands and the size 0 fit me well ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress it looks beautiful on the model but it is n't the flattering even on sale i am not sure if it would be worth it it it runs pretty big ."
__label__-1 "did n't work on this curvy gal . sizing up would have helped with the button gaps but the flowy shape of the blouse would have looked too maternity on a larger size . major pass ."
__label__1 "i was looking for a dress for my engagement pictures and once i saw this dress i knew it was the one ! i ordered the white in a small ( size 2 ) i am 5 ' 4 130lbs . it fits perfect and the length is just right . some reviews said it 's boxy and has too much flow to it but if you have the right size it wo n't be an issue ! yes it 's a lace dress so it 's going to be delicate and you 'll need to handle with care . but it 's worth it absolutely stunning !"
__label__-1 "i fell in love with this cute top however after reading reviews i am going to return it . seems there is a problem with it shrinking after following washing instructions . who wants to dry clean a tank top ? not me sadly . too bad . style was cute and color was awesome ."
__label__-1 "is gigantic-it could be so cute but the neckline and armholes are ridiculously low . i am 5 feet 10 and 140 pounds and a small was huge on me ."
__label__0 "i was very excited about this dress but when it came i saw it had too much going on . it either needs the ruffle taken away ( my first choice ) or the halter part taken away . in the end i think it needs to go back ."
__label__-1 "really disappointing quality . these jeans are of a very poor quality material and developed holes in the inseams after only a month ! i love pilcros and am totally shocked at the poor quality ... retailer i hope this is just a fluke . not worth the money !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this cardigan on sale and it was a wonderful fit and color . just the light sort of cute pullover i was looking for to keep and wear at work . unfortunately it is poorly made . i wore it once and it already started to fray and fall apart . after closely inspecting the cause i realized that the threads in the sweater are not fully sewed together so the minute you put it on one will start to unravel leading to a domino effect . it is a shame because the design and cut were truly a great f"
__label__0 "i want to like this sweater . the color is lovely more of a grayish blue and the design is nice . the quality is amazingly good as it 's thick without being too thick and very soft . but the design is odd and quite unflattering ! i got the xsmall but it 's two big . the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look . it does n't look like it does on this model . the waist area is a lot bigger so it does sit on your hips however the sweater is n't slimming cause of the odd shape"
__label__-1 "i know this is supposed to look oversized and i own a few oversized ponchos but this takes oversized to a whole new level . i ordered it in my usual size and it was just waaaaay too much fabric - i do not think sizing down would have made a difference . if you are looking for that it seemed like good qualify ."
__label__0 "this top is not for a curvy figure . the embroidered part is gorgeous very stunning but the loose bottom part is awful . i am curvy and usually wear l or xl . this top was fitted at the top but very loose at the bottom made me feel like i had a big tummy and was a tad short . i am sending this back . this would look better on a more slender frame ."
__label__-1 "i 'm returning this jacket . i tried it on after it was delivered and was happy with the weight cut and color although it 's more dusty mauve than it looks in the picture . however the stitching and the zipper are of such poor quality that i doubt it will last very long . i actually ca n't get the zipper to zip at all . it 's very rough and lightweight and i 'm afraid if i keep trying to force it i 'll just end up breaking it . sorry to say yet another retailer item turns out to be poor quality . thi"
__label__0 "this top is very strange . i agree with the other reviewer in that i think it 's not cotton . it clung and got bunched up around my chest . like in a static cling way . there 's just something about the way it hangs that is not flattering . too bad as i was really looking forward to wearing this but alas it 's going back ."
__label__1 "versatile and comfy . can be worn with shirts underneath for multi-seasonal wear ."
__label__1 "i purchased all 4 of the color/pattern offered . all fit beautifully and have washed up great with no shrinkage with line dry . the only pair i had retuned were the blue motif because they were made from a very different material with not near as much stretch and felt much smaller to me and not as comfortable . the pattern was cute and may work just fine with those who have a different build . i felt these were in general true to size . no doubt i will wear these all winter ! thanks antro ! !"
__label__1 "fun top for day or evening ."
__label__-1 "boxy short & wide ! luv this brand but super disappointed with this design ..."
__label__1 "this top is great and perfect for fall/winter . i 've gotten a lot of wear out of this so far ... great with jeans and sneakers for a casual look or dress it up with black jeans and boots . great layering piece as well . the fabric is soft and comfortable . the fit is nice and relaxed but tailored on the sides to give you some shape . the colors are beautiful.great buy i highly recommend !"
__label__-1 "i have to agree that the fit is unfortunate . i am using a size 2 in retailer and most dresses . i knew to size up based on reviews here . i tried the size 4 and i could barely button the top . the waist fit fine and the underarms was fitted nicely to the body . i sized up to a size 6 and the dress was oversized in the top with gaping armholes . too bad because the color is beautiful and the style is adorable ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited for this dress to arrive but when it did it was a major disappointment . there is no lining on the skirt portion of the dress leaving it sheer . also the top part along the chest puckered in a weird unflattering way . the colors were beautiful but not enough to to make up for the other design flaws . i am 5 ' 6 140lb and the small fit tts . will be sending it back"
__label__1 "i adore this skirt - it is so soft and flowy . i was not sure if the mesh would be a bit stiff but it 's not at all . the dots are soft as is the main fabric . i could wear this all day long and be very comfy . the underlying fabric is a bit more taupe than gold in color . i am between sizes to i sized up and was glad i did- no pinch at the waist . i love that it 's feminine yet funky and could be worn formally or in fun . it is midi-length as you see on the model . absolutely a great buy !"
__label__1 "this is the prettiest little nighty . it is romantic soft and so very pretty . i really adore everything about this piece but the pink detail on the trim along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love ."
__label__1 "loved this skirt . it reminded me of the styles that i saw visiting paris this past summer ."
__label__1 "i know it 's a bit of a moot point since the chemise has sold out - but on the off chance any come back in stock or if you see one at your local store - i urge you to try it on ! the fabric is incredible . so luxurious . it fits me amazingly . i have a hard time with the whole tight chemise/slip/nightie category of clothing as i 'm fairly skinny but still curvy and while i love my curves i do have a muffin top that can get real awkward when you 're trying to look sexy . this however is a godsend ."
__label__1 "i purchased this in my usual small ( size 4-6 ) and it fits just the way it shows in the photo . it is very flowy which is th point . i wore it over a black romper and it looked great . i can also wear with jeans and a simple black tank . keep the vest open or use the hook and eye and close it up . seeing the black through the sheer white is simply dreamy ! glad i purchased it during the sale on sale promotion . it is a classic piece for sure ."
__label__0 "i really was looking forward to this piece but unfortunately it was too small to even pass through my head nevertheless i could n't even get both arms in . i got a size small and probably needed a large ; but as far as the quality and color it 's really pretty ! just go up a size or two if anything and try it out ."
__label__1 "i love this dress it is very photo friendly which is a big plus for me . i am not the tallest person 5 ' 4 but i had to be careful not to get my sleeves in the food i was preparing . perhaps the sleeve length is a bit longer on me but i had to be very cautious while trying to put the finishing touches on our holiday feast . it 's just something to be aware of . i suggest sushi or a nice cheese plate if you want to wear it as the hostess ."
__label__1 "as soon as i saw this online i knew i 'd love it and when it arrived in my store i scooped it up right away ! ! ! the poncho is exactly as it appears online . the color is different variations of gray . the fabric is soft and not itchy at all . it 's longer in back has arm holes on either side and lays beautifully . it 's long enough to wear with leggings but looks clean enough to pair with jeans and a top . this is light enough for cool summer nights but will be my fall go to once the cold weather com"
__label__1 "this top caught my eye in the store due to the beautiful print and lovely fabric . the photo really does n't do it justice . i happened to have on a pencil skirt when i tried it on and the top looked great with my skirt though i will probably wear it more often with jeans or pants . it 's a stunner !"
__label__0 "frumpy is the word i would use to describe this top . i look good in empire waist shirts and seek them out . but this one made me look pregnant and frumpy . and it has an attached camisole but the sheerness of the top still showed my nude-colored bra strap . so i do n't even know what to wear under it . it 's going back even with the sale price ."
__label__1 "falls beautifully and the color is vibrant . can be dressed up or worn casually . texture adds even more uniqueness . a little heavy but this is outweighed by its other lovely features ."
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i ordered an xsmall and a small . i am 5 ' 6 and 110 lbs slender build . the xsmall fit great everywhere but the waist band was completely out of portion for the dress . both sizes will have to be returned . possibly if you have a more straight up and down figure it will fit better and pull in your waist !"
__label__-1 "the front cream panel is completely transparent.i did n't purchase because my bra showed and it would ruin the look with a cami underneath . i wish the fabric were translucent - not so see through ."
__label__1 "love this tank . it is so soft and comfortable . the length hits just right on the hip . it hugs the body nicely not too tight just loose enough on a hot summer day . i have this in black and white . i wish they would offer more colors ."
__label__1 "this is the softest shirt super comfy very baggy but i 'd say true to size for the style . it is a bit thin and i 'm worried how it will hold up or would have given the full 5 stars . i 'm not a usual fan of the turtle neck but this is so soft i love it !"
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a 4 ( 34b 140lbs . 5 ' 8 ) because it looked like it would run big and it definitely does ! the 4 fit comfortably but the cut of this dress made me look about 10 lbs . heavier than i am . i am pear-shaped and this dress made me look very bottom heavy so i returned it . that said the material is gorgeous ! as it is the perfect weight and the colors are much more striking and complementary in person . if i had a straight ( er ) silhouette and a larger bust this dress would have been a"
__label__0 "so i have n't actually tried this and i 'm sorry for the misleading star rating . i just wanted to get someone 's attention on the length . the photos show the dress draping with almost a train even with the model in platform heels but in the video the dress is about 2 inches off the floor . is it the model in the video that is extra tall ? someone help me out . this looks gorgeous but since it 's an online exclusive i wo n't be able to try it on at the store ."
__label__0 "i recommen only becuase i like it on other people but not on me . the pull on style did n't work i need xs petite to fit lenght and waist but the waist was n't elastic enough to pull up ( i have let 's say a booty # . i kept hearing hte stiching give ... it also looked a little too poooofffy on my frmae i am 5 ' 1.5 and it stuck more out than on the model . nice idea btu not for me . # i am 115 lbs #"
__label__1 "love this sweater ! it can be used for both work and casual wear with ease . very soft and seems durable . i highly recommend it !"
__label__0 "i loved the colors on this dress but i do n't like the way it fits . it is tight around the shoulders but the rest of the dress is really big and has no shape"
__label__-1 "maybe i should n't have sized up to an xl but i 'm not sure a smaller size would have solved the weird fit . the vee is quite low and i 'm busty . it 'll be really low if you 're smaller on top . the fit from back to front where it ties looked horrible on me . not tight at all . it 's almost balloon like around the hem and from the side view i looked like a really wide green apple . i hate leaving a bad review because i know someone may love it but i would n't recommend it ."

__label__-1 "the quality and fabric of this dress are lovely but unfortunately i found it to be very unflattering and shapeless . it fit me like a sack i ordered the m and i suppose i should 've sized down but even in the s i 'm afraid this would be far too large . for reference i am 5 ' 7 and 135 lbs . i have a curvy build so this shape dress just was n't right on me . i imagine it will look cute on more of a boyish figure . returned ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this in a small petite and medium petite and i am a huge fan of a * k. i put tried on the sp . while it fit it was very long even for a petite . what i hated about it was that the piping on the top made me look very wide . even a long necklace would n't help deter the look . on a positive side the blue was a very nice cool color . i am usually a small to medium in a * k ( 6-8 in tops ) and the small fit well in the arms/bodice just too much fabric for me . returning !"

__label__-1 "sadly this has to go back . i am 5 ' 5 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me . very short . and it 's so wide it 's almost a trapeze cut . the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt . which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful the detail is nice in person even the sleeve cuffs are great . i am not very tall and i 'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles loose and tight . the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering ."
__label__-1 "this top really is lovely . i had high hopes of it looking smashing with black jeans . i wash everything before i wear it . though this garment says it needs to be dry cleaned there was nothing so delicate about the fabric that it had to be dry cleaned . so i hand washed it with delicate soap . when the lighter colors came into contact with the black the black immediately stained the light color . i tried putting some stain remover on the black stains rinsed and hung it above my bath tub . it is cur"

__label__-1 "this dress is a potato sack ! from the picture i thought it was going to be a cute drop waist dress but the tailoring is so weird ! ! and it 's huge on me so maybe it would be better if i sized down but again based on the tailoring i think not . also the fabric is strange not at all what i expected . i 'm so sad : ( i was really excited about this dress ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt so much i came back and bought it in black ( i originally got the lavender color ) . it is super easy to wear and has a delicate quality to it ( though i washed it on a regular cycle and it 's holding up well ! ) . as you can see from the photos because of the wrap style the middle of the front is shorter than the rest of the shirt . i 've worn this top with regular rise jeans and have n't had a problem though if you lift your arms your belly may show . i purchased my usual size small"
__label__1 "love these pants they do run small in the hip area and are not stretchy at all . so beware if you are curvy you might want to size up . great quality and style overall ."
__label__1 "i love this top ! although i wish i had ordered the large rather than the medium . i am 5 ' 4 138 pounds and a 34d . the medium just fits but is ever so slightly snug across my shoulders . it will work ; though i will probably have it dry cleaned rather than risk shrinkage by washing at home ."
__label__1 "the color is deep coral and perfect for fall to top jeans or leggings . i love the big slouchy look so the drapey quality is a plus ."
__label__1 "this color is gorgeous . this could be dressed up or down . great buy !"
__label__0 "this is a gorgeous top ; however it is very sheer and see through . maybe the fabric would have been better if it was a bit thicker ?"
__label__0 "i really liked the look of this top online but when it came i had a couple of issues with it . first when i tried it on i found the underarms to be a little snug ( i normally wear a 10/m and that 's what i ordered ) . it makes raising my arms tough and as a teacher i need to be able to lift my arms above my waist . secondly my husband 's first reaction was that it looks like pajamas . the abstract floral/stripe gets a little lost . on the other hand the color palette is very pretty and the qual"
__label__0 "this dress is adorable . the color is on the red orange side and is nice for the summer . the cotton is also nice and light . however the bust is cut short and the skirt is unforgiving to girls with hips . if you have b/c cup or less and do not have an hour glass figure then this dress may be for you ."
__label__0 "the fit on these is good for my hourglass shape and the fabric quality and comfort is good too.i think the rinse is just not as nice in person- the orange stitching is pretty bright too . i bought . a pair from br a couple months ago that are almost identical in quality fit and color that i got for less than half the price of these . i am going to return these and see if they have something better but will only buy in store from now on ."
__label__0 "love the cut and the way they drape . size 26 and 5 ' 6 135lbs fit great until you wear them for an hour . all of a sudden my 26s became 28s . they were practically falling off . i plan to wash them to see if they shrink . i wish they held their shape since they are so cute ."
__label__0 "this is a comfortable sweater dress and the quality of the material seems good . the solid blue strip down the front makes it look very bland . i think it would need some dressing up with a necklace or scarf . i decided to pass ."
